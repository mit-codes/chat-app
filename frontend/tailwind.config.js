// Tailwind v4 does not strictly require this file if using the CSS-first configuration,
// but if we keep it, it might conflict or be ignored if not configured correctly.
// For v4 with PostCSS, we can usually just use the CSS file.
// However, to avoid confusion, I'll keep a minimal one or rely on the CSS.
// Let's comment it out or leave it empty if we move config to CSS.
// Actually, with v4, user requested Tailwind v4 setup implicitly by getting v4 installed.
// I will clear this file effectively or make it compatible if possible.
// But v4 detects config in CSS mainly.

  // v4 config is often in CSS
